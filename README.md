# DBMS
Hands down the best compiled way to learn about database systems and SQL

<ins>**Key Features of DBMS**
</br>
1.**Data modeling:** A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.

2.**Data storage and retrieval:** A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.

3.**Concurrency control:** A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.

4.**Data integrity and security:** A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.

5.**Backup and recovery:** A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.

6.**DBMS can be classified into two types:** Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)

7.**RDBMS:** Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data are related to each other through primary and foreign keys.

8.**NoSQL:** Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios..
